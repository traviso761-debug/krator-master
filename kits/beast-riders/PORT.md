# kits/beast-riders: port audit

*Written by `tools/audit_port.py` (GODOT-PLAN.md, section 3). Edit the **Tag** and **Note** cells and the text under "Notes": a rerun keeps them and refreshes the numbers. `--reset` retags everything.*

Tags: `[G data]` engine-neutral, port or export · `[G shader]` rewrite once as a .gdshader · `[G native]` Godot has it, keep for the preview · `[web]` host code, quarantine in `core/host/` · `[draw]` a three.js builder whose output crosses over as meshes. "split" in a note means the fragment mixes data with drawing or host code and needs a data pass and a draw pass.

| | [G data] | [G shader] | [G native] | [web] | [draw] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KB | 4 (14%) | 0 (0%) | 0 (0%) | 10 (40%) | 11 (45%) |

Columns: matching lines per API family. `canvas` is canvas 2D (texture painters), `DOM` and `events` and `loop` are the browser, `shader` is GLSL and shader hooks, `inst` is InstancedMesh, `ray` is Raycaster, `geom` is geometry-kit calls (BOX, F.box, kdef, *Geometry). `store` and `net` should stay 0.
