# Texture prompts still needed (one list)

Every texture or pattern sheet the owner still has to source or generate, each with its finished prompt. Paste a block
as it is, one image per block. Nothing in sections 1 to 3 is in `core/materials/library/` or `core/materials/patterns/` on any branch
or worktree (checked 2026-10-14; the two redos in section 3 replace sets that came unusable), and no "Delivered" log in `PLAN.md` or `PROMPTS-ready.md` covers it.

**Count: 11 prompts (section 2: the Northern Highlands' three; section 4: `card.crop.indigo`; section 5: `rock.sandstone.bedded.red`; section 6: six for the Throne's new flora).** Everything in sections 1 to 3 was delivered on 2026-10-18 (`tex2.zip`, see "Delivered 2026-10-18"). A short list at the end names gaps that have no prompt yet.

This file replaces the scattered "still owed" lists as the place to look. The prompts were gathered from
`PLAN.md` ("Prompts for generated sources" and the audits below it), `PROMPTS-ready.md`, `PROMPTS-nomads.md`,
`PROMPTS-iziz-beast-riders.md`, `settlements/ys/MATERIAL-PROMPTS.md`, every `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `TODO.md` and
`tools/textures/HANDOFF-local.md`. Those files are now history: their open rows are copied here.

## How to deliver

- **Name each image after its id** (slashes become folders: `patterns/islander/gable-west.png`). Square 2048 px unless
  the entry says otherwise. A scan that matches is as good as a generated image.
- **Process.** Surfaces and pattern sheets: write a batch file in `tools/textures/batches/` (the exact prompt goes in
  `_source.prompt`, `"pattern": true` for a pattern sheet so it is cropped to its period) and run
  `python3 tools/textures/process.py --batch tools/textures/batches/<delivery>.json "<folder of images>"`. Cut-out
  sheets on magenta go through `tools/textures/cards.py` (its chroma key). Check every set on a contact sheet:
  `python3 tools/textures/preview.py <scratch>/sheet.jpg <set dirs>`.
- **Where sets land:** `core/materials/library/<id>/` or `core/materials/patterns/<culture>/<name>/` (`albedo.jpg`,
  `normal.jpg`, `roughness.png`, `meta.json`). Never commit an original or anything over 1024 px; `meta.json` records the
  source's sha1 and the prompt.
- **Wire it:** add the family to the build's `materials.json`, run `python3 tools/textures/pack.py <build>` (writes
  `<build>/tex/`, commit it), rebuild the build and verify it.
- **Then prune:** delete the entry here, add a line to a "Delivered" log in `PLAN.md`, and close the build's
  `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` item.

Conventions (`PLAN.md`, "Prompts for generated sources" and "Rules, from now"): every block starts with the base
template. **Near-colourless** (tintable) blocks end with the muting sentence and carry no tint hexes: the build's palette
colours them. **Full colour** blocks keep their hexes. Pattern sheets put "a flat, front-on decorative panel" in place of
"perfectly flat surface". Cut-outs are always on solid flat bright magenta (#ff00ff), never grey or white.

## 0. Redo: delivered 2026-10-14, needs another take

Each is the original prompt with a correction at the end. The first take stays installed until the redo arrives.
**2026-10-15:** five of the six redos arrived (all but `patterns/tribal/formline`) and are in the library, **not wired**: each says which build to re-pack. Do those re-packs before the Godot export (`GODOT-PLAN.md`, "Before an export: textures delivered but not wired").

#### `patterns/tribal/formline`
- Installed: Highlands `formF`. Why again: came mirror-symmetric, not periodic: the seam shows a doubled eye pair.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Flat, front-on decorative panel of Northwest-coast formline painting on cedar: bold swelling black (#171311) formlines with ovoids and U-shapes, the inner shapes in red (#b3322a) and teal (#2e9488), on a cedar-wood ground (#b27a4c, shading to #8a5634), hand-painted and slightly worn, the wood grain faintly showing. Abstract: no readable figures. The pattern repeats horizontally. Full colour. Correction: the design must repeat, not mirror: the right half is not a reflection of the left, and the motif at the right edge continues straight into the motif at the left edge.
```

#### `ground.travertine.white`
- Installed: the geyser `ground.tufa`. Why again: turquoise water was painted in the pools (the shader lays the water).
- **Redo delivered 2026-10-15** (`Downloads/vothtex.zip`, "Dry Travertine Terrace Texture.png"; batch `redos-2026-10-15.json`): in `library/ground.travertine.white`, replacing the first take. **Not wired:** `biomes/geyser/tex/` still holds the first take. Re-pack it (`python3 tools/textures/pack.py biomes/geyser`), rebuild and verify **before the Godot export**.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Travertine terraces seen from directly above, like Pamukkale: bright white calcite (#f2f0ea) laid down by flowing spring water in scalloped rimstone dams, each dam a smooth rounded lip a hand wide curving in lobes, its outer face draped with fine vertical drip ridges and small stalactite fringes; between the dams shallow pools of pale milky turquoise water (#9ad8d8) over a smooth white floor; faint cream (#e8dcc0) and pale orange-brown (#c8905a) stains where the water slows. Full colour. Correction: the pools are empty and dry: bare white and cream crust in the hollows, no water, no turquoise, no reflections.
```

#### `hide.sleek`
- Installed: fauna `sleek`. Why again: came mid-brown (installed muted 0.8); the vertex colour gives the hue.
- **Redo delivered 2026-10-15** ("Seamless Grayscale Fur Texture.png"): in `library/hide.sleek`, neutral grey, processed with no muting (the first take needed 0.8). **Not wired:** re-pack `kits/fauna` (and drop its `sleek` mute if it carries one), rebuild and verify **before the Godot export**.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Short sleek animal coat seen close up, as on a horse or a deer: very short dense glossy hairs all lying in one direction, faint swirls where the hair changes direction, a soft sheen along the hair, no spots, stripes or markings. Light neutral warm grey-tan so it can be tinted. Keep colours natural but slightly muted and even, so the texture can be tinted to different palettes without looking stained. Correction: neutral mid-grey (#8a8a8a), fully desaturated: no brown, tan or warm cast; only the light and dark of the hide.
```

#### `patterns/islander/storyboard`
- Installed: Islanders `patStory`. Why again: one frigate bird is cut by the left/right seam.
- **Redo delivered 2026-10-15** ("Polynesian Canoe and Sea Life Mural.png"): in `patterns/islander/storyboard`; the figures sit clear of the seams. **Not wired:** re-pack `kits/islanders`, rebuild and verify **before the Godot export**.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Flat, front-on decorative panel of a Palauan bai storyboard, a carved and painted gable relief in two registers between black and white toothed bands: in the upper register a red canoe with five black paddlers under a white full moon, in the lower one red and white fish and black frigate birds in flight, outlined black (#1e1a18) on an ochre (#c8922e) ground, the relief shallow and hand-cut. The pattern repeats horizontally. Full colour. Correction: every figure whole inside the frame, none touching or crossing an edge; a strip of plain ground runs along the left and right edges so the seam falls on empty ground.
```

#### `patterns/common/grime-streaks`
- Installed: the breakup hook's `grime` parameter. Why again: came as 20 x 8 cells, dark on white (asked: 16 x 8 on transparent).
- **Redo delivered 2026-10-15** ("Grayscale Drip Texture Grid.png", on magenta): keyed to white and processed into `patterns/common/grime-streaks` (the installed form: dark on white). **It is 20 columns by 8 rows again**, not the 16 by 8 asked: whatever reads it must take 20 x 8. No build on this branch packs it yet; wire it (the break-up hook's `grime`) **before the Godot export**.

```
A sheet of 128 separate grime streak masks in a grid of 16 columns by 8 rows, square, 2048x2048, each cell twice as tall as it is wide, on a solid flat pure white background. Front-on, flat, even, shadowless lighting; no text, no border, no grid lines. Each cell holds one vertical stain as on a wall below a window sill or a cornice: it starts at the top edge of its cell as a soft band and runs down, fading out before the bottom edge, nothing crossing into the next cell. Vary them: soot, damp, rust run-off, narrow drips, wide washes, single, forked and several parallel runs, some short, some long. Greyscale only, from pale grey to near-black where the stain is strongest, no colour at all. Correction: exactly 16 columns by 8 rows of separate streaks, each in its own cell with a margin, on a solid magenta (#ff00ff) ground, no white.
```

#### `patterns/islander/gable-east-b`
- Installed: Islanders `patGableE2` (the great uma). Why again: drifts: no exact period, a soft seam.
- **Redo delivered 2026-10-15** ("Seamless Geometric Bamboo Weave.png"): in `patterns/islander/gable-east-b`, an exact period both ways. **Not wired:** re-pack `kits/islanders` (`patGableE2`), rebuild and verify **before the Godot export**.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Flat, front-on decorative panel of a woven split-bamboo house facade as on an Ede or Sumba house: a cream (#e6d8b8) woven field in horizontal bands, alternating rows of large nested diamonds in black (#1e1a18) and ochre (#c8922e) with a small dark red (#6e1a12) heart, and rows of triple zigzag lines, thin black bands between the rows, visible weave in every strip. The pattern repeats horizontally. Full colour. Correction: exactly three diamonds across and two rows down, the repeat lining up exactly at the edges, no drift in spacing or size across the image.
```
## 1. Visibly worse without (open in a KNOWN_ISSUES)

### The geyser basin (`biomes/geyser`)

*All delivered 2026-10-14 (see "Delivered 2026-10-14" below).*

`biomes/geyser/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: "Six surfaces are procedural until the owner's textures arrive." The two surfaces' stand-ins
are rows in `biomes/geyser/materials.json` (swap their `lib`); the four cards are the kit's own slots. `PLAN.md`, "The
geyser basin", has each set's reuse.

### The Fauna kit (`kits/fauna`)

*All delivered 2026-10-14 (see "Delivered 2026-10-14" below).*

### The Islanders kit (`kits/islanders`)

*All delivered 2026-10-14 (see "Delivered 2026-10-14" below).*

`kits/islanders/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: "The painted motifs are canvas stand-ins" (`28-is-paint.js`), and "no hinggi sheet yet".
Full colour. Palette `ISP_C`: red earth #9a2a1e, dark red #6e1a12, black #1e1a18, white #efe6d2, ochre #c8922e, sea teal
#2a7a7a, sand #c49a5a, bark #8a5a32, cream #e6d8b8. Each sheet lands at `patterns/islander/<name>`; add its family key
(below) to `kits/islanders/materials.json` and repack: the canvas is then never drawn (`KIT_HAS`), no code change.

### The Scyvoi kit (`kits/scyvoi`)

*All delivered 2026-10-14 (see "Delivered 2026-10-14" below).*

### Iziz (`settlements/iziz`)

*All delivered 2026-10-14 (see "Delivered 2026-10-14" below).*

`settlements/iziz/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, "Two surfaces have no good library texture" (the second material pilot, 2026-10-13).
Both near-colourless, tinted.

### The Resources kit (`kits/resources`)

`kits/resources/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: "The veins, crusts, seams, pools and grains are vertex colours on simple shapes: the
library has no ore or mineral sets". The nodes are boxes and ellipsoids, so a set is laid on the face that shows the
mineral (a seam band, a crust patch, a pool rim): each lands as a family in `kits/resources/materials.json`, and
`44r-res-nodes.js` draws that face with its key in place of `plain` (a small code change per kind, after delivery). Full
colour: the colour is the point. Sulfur needs no image: `ground.sulphur` is in the library (wired 2026-10-15).

### The Ring Sea isles biome (`biomes/ringisles`)

`biomes/ringisles/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, "Stand-ins": the lagoon floor, the reef, the coral and seven leaf cards are procedural or near library sets. Each lands as a family in `biomes/ringisles/materials.json` (a card through `BIO.libSwap`). The banana, rice, cane and greens leaves have no prompt yet (see "Gaps with no prompt yet").

## 2. Still owed (no open known issue; the build draws its own today)

### Highlands (`settlements/highlands`)

*All delivered 2026-10-14 (see "Delivered 2026-10-14" below).*

The two other harlequin colourways in the source (`73b-hl-frame.js:239-240`, `hlHarl(ground, diamond, seam)`); only the
green one (`patterns/highlands/harlequin`, `hHarlG`) was delivered. Glazed roof tile on the tents (`hTentHR`, `hTentHG`)
and the bulb domes (`hBulbHG`), drawn by the canvas painter today. Full colour, repeats both ways.

### The Northern Highlands (`biomes/nhighlands`): the new flora (2026-10-18)

Painted in code today (`biomes/nhighlands/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, the new flora). The fan-leaf, the moss sleeves, the table
cedar, the serpentwood and the banyan have library candidates already (`card.ginkgo`, `ground.moss001`-`003`,
`card.spruce`, `bark.mossy`, `bark.smooth`): wiring them is the owner's call, no prompt needed.

#### `card.staghorn`

```
A staghorn fern (Platycerium) frond cut-out: one long antler-like frond forking three times into rounded tips, mid green #7aa040 with lighter edges #a8c870, fine felted surface, isolated on flat pure magenta (#FF00FF), front view, the frond's base at the left edge pointing right, whole frond in frame, no shadow. Matte.
```

#### `card.sunwheel`

```
An alien ground rosette seen from directly above: thirty-five slender stalks radiating flat from a tight central bud, each stalk ending in a perfect wheel of twelve narrow pointed leaflets, the wheels smaller toward the centre, bright yellow-green #a8d048 to #b4d850, too regular to be an Earth plant, isolated on flat pure magenta (#FF00FF), top-down orthographic, whole rosette in frame, no shadow. Matte.
```

#### `bark.alder.lichen`

```
Seamless tileable texture, 2048x2048, front orthographic, flat even lighting, no shadows: smooth pale grey alder bark #9c9e96 heavily mottled with white and pale green-grey crustose lichen patches #d8dcd0 and #b8c4a8, a few dark horizontal lenticels #4a4a44, green moss creeping up from the bottom edge #5a7a26. Matte. One tile covers 1 metre.
```

### Ys (`settlements/ys`)

*All delivered 2026-10-14 (see "Delivered 2026-10-14" below).*

From `settlements/ys/MATERIAL-PROMPTS.md`, "The ocean's rust" (Travis, 2026-10-05: "the ancient buildings here are quite
rusty"); every other set in that file was delivered. Not tinted. Since 2026-10-06 Ys' ruined concrete takes
`concrete.ancient` (`KMAT.bindMat`), so the drowned Ancients are textured, just not rusty; `MAT.rust` stays procedural.

### The Fauna kit (`kits/fauna`)

*All delivered 2026-10-14 (see "Delivered 2026-10-14" below).*

From `PLAN.md`, "The Fauna kit": "Still needed for fauna". Triplanar detail maps under each animal's vertex colours, so
both are near-colourless.

### The Pylon kit (`kits/pylon`)

The kit draws in the Iziz Vernacular's sets and the library's (`kits/pylon/materials.json`); these three it has no set for
(`kits/pylon/PLAN.md` section 8). Each lands in the library or `patterns/pylon/`; add its family to
`kits/pylon/materials.json` and repack.

#### `tile.hex.glazed`
- Kind: tileable material, near-colourless (tinted amber by the kit); 1 m tile. The honeycomb-tiled walls and street of
  the owner's `refs/1b13731cac223929fb36a94b49c88603.jpg`: rich interiors, the scrap exchange's floors, hex paving.
- Reuse: any glazed hexagonal tile floor or wall (a bath house, a Yuni kitchen, a Hykkousoi hall), tinted to taste.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Glazed ceramic hexagonal tiles about 10 cm across, set flat-side to flat-side in a honeycomb, about twenty tiles across the image: each tile slightly domed with a soft glaze sheen, faint variation of glaze thickness from tile to tile, a few hairline crazing cracks, one or two chipped corners, narrow dark grout lines between them. Pale grey glaze, dark grey grout. Keep colours natural but slightly muted and even, so the texture can be tinted to different palettes without looking stained.
```

#### `patterns/pylon/hex-grille`
- Kind: cut-out sheet on magenta, near-colourless; 1 m across. The Ancients' grille in the portholes and lattice
  screens (`refs/ancient office.jpg`, `ancient 2.jpg`, `honeycomb arch.jpg`), drawn now as two crossed iron bars.
- Reuse: any metal hex lattice: vents, gates, window grilles, a dome's skin, catwalk floors.

```
A flat, front-on decorative panel, square, 2048x2048, on a solid flat magenta background (#ff00ff). Orthographic, flat even shadowless lighting, no cast shadows, no perspective, no text, no border. The pattern must repeat: the left edge continues into the right edge and the top into the bottom. The panel: a metal honeycomb grille, a lattice of flat bars about a finger wide forming regular hexagonal openings about a hand across, eight openings across the image, the bars bevelled at their edges with a little wear on the corners and faint machining lines along them; every opening shows only the solid magenta background through it. Dark neutral grey metal. Keep colours natural but slightly muted and even, so the texture can be tinted to different palettes without looking stained. Hard clean edges against the magenta, no anti-aliased fringe of other colours. No magenta, pink or purple anywhere in the metal.
```

#### `plaster.painted.worn`
- Kind: tileable material, full colour; 2 m tile. The salvage tier's and the folk houses' orange paint, flaking to the grey
  render and concrete beneath (the kit tints white stucco orange today, so wear does not show).
- Reuse: any painted render worn back to its base: Talia's poor orange quarter (`talia (6).jpg`), weathered Iziz shops.
- **Check:** `plaster.white_stucco_02` tinted orange may be enough at a distance; judge both on the folk houses first.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: An old rendered wall painted bright orange (#e07a2a), the paint faded and chalky and flaking away in irregular patches to show smooth grey cement render (#8e8b86) beneath, about a third of the surface bare; the paint edges lifted and cracked, a few hairline cracks in the render, faint vertical streaks of grime below the patches. Full colour (do not mute).
```

### The Talia kit (`kits/talia`)

The kit draws in the library's marble, gold and clay tile (`kits/talia/materials.json`); these four it has no set for
(`kits/talia/PLAN.md` section 7). Each lands in the library or `patterns/talia/`; add its family to
`kits/talia/materials.json` and repack.

#### `mosaic.honeycomb`
- Kind: tileable material, full colour; 1 m tile. The orange-gold mosaic over the trumpet vaults, coffers and column
  flares of Talia's halls (`refs/taliaint3.jpg`) and the cloister ceilings (`talia-cloisters.jpg`).
- Reuse: any gilded or orange mosaic vault or apse, Iziz's rich interiors.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: A mosaic of small irregular polygonal glass tesserae about 2 cm across, packed like a honeycomb or a cracked glaze, each one a slightly different shade of warm orange and gold (#e89a30, #d8822a, #f0b048, #c87420), a few gold-leaf tesserae with a faint metallic sheen, thin pale cream grout lines (#efe6d2) between them, a slight unevenness of the surface. Full colour (do not mute).
```

#### `patterns/talia/meander`
- Kind: pattern sheet, full colour, 2048x512, repeating along its length; a band 0.5 m tall. The Greek-key border of
  Talia's floors and friezes (`refs/talia-cloisters.jpg`).
- Reuse: any classical floor border or frieze band (Hykkousoi halls, Republic civic floors), tinted or as is.

```
A flat, front-on decorative panel, 2048x512, a long horizontal band. Orthographic, flat even shadowless lighting, no perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The band must repeat along its length: the left edge continues into the right edge. The panel: a Greek key (meander) border in white marble inlay (#f4f1ea) on a ground of orange marble (#ee7a1c), the key a continuous squared spiral line about a tenth of the band's height wide, running the whole length, with a thin white fillet along the top and bottom edges of the band; the marble shows faint veining, the inlay joints are fine and tight. Full colour (do not mute).
```

#### `patterns/talia/jali`
- Kind: cut-out sheet on magenta, near-colourless; 1 m across. The pierced stone screens of the jharokha bays and the
  palace's upper pavilions (`refs/talia3.jpg`).
- Reuse: any pierced stone or plaster screen: Mughal-style windows, a harem lattice, Erewhon's citadel.

```
A flat, front-on decorative panel, square, 2048x2048, on a solid flat magenta background (#ff00ff). Orthographic, flat even shadowless lighting, no cast shadows, no perspective, no text, no border. The pattern must repeat: the left edge continues into the right edge and the top into the bottom. The panel: a pierced stone screen (jali) of interlocking eight-pointed stars and small hexagons, the stone bars about two fingers wide with softly rounded carved edges and fine chisel texture, the openings about a third of the area, five star motifs across the image; every opening shows only the solid magenta background through it. Pale warm grey stone. Keep colours natural but slightly muted and even, so the texture can be tinted to different palettes without looking stained. Hard clean edges against the magenta, no anti-aliased fringe of other colours. No magenta, pink or purple anywhere in the stone.
```

#### `patterns/talia/rose-window`
- Kind: one cut-out panel on magenta, full colour, 2048x2048, not tiled; the window is about 9 m across. The star rose of
  Talia's temple front (`refs/talia-temple.jpg`), drawn now as a plain glazed disc.
- Reuse: any rose or oculus window (a chapel, a guild hall's gable).

```
A flat, front-on decorative panel, square, 2048x2048, on a solid flat magenta background (#ff00ff). Orthographic, flat even shadowless lighting, no cast shadows, no perspective, no text. The panel: one circular stained-glass rose window filling the square, edge touching the edge, seen straight on and lit from behind: a sixteen-pointed star pattern of lozenge panes radiating from a white glass centre, the panes slate blue (#4a6a8a), pale gold (#d8c07a), cream (#efe6d2) and a few deep cobalt (#2f5fb8), set in dark lead cames (#2a2624) with a thin stone ring round the outside; everything outside the circle is solid magenta. Full colour (do not mute). Hard clean edges against the magenta, no anti-aliased fringe of other colours. No magenta, pink or purple anywhere in the window.
```

## 3. Probably needed: check first

Each has a reason it may not be owed. Settle the reason, then generate or drop the entry.

## Delivered 2026-10-14

The owner delivered thirty-five images in seven batches (WebP, 1254 px; the caihua 1774 x 887). Each was processed as `core/materials/PLAN.md` says (batches `tools/textures/batches/owner-2026-10-14.json` and `-cards.json`) and wired; `PLAN.md`, "Delivered 2026-10-14", has the checks and the details. The entries are kept here with their prompts.

#### `ground.travertine.white`
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 6.webp. `library/ground.travertine.white`, full colour. Wired: biomes/geyser `ground.tufa` (the Stair), kept at 0.2 of its colour so its painted pools read as pale crust under the shader's own water.
- Kind: tileable material, full colour. Seen from above.
- Used by: the Stair's terraces. Stands in today: `stone.travertine.tufa`, greyed and whitened (Pamukkale's rims are
  whiter and smoother). Reuse: any travertine spring.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge.

  scale, so the image must have no direction.
- Used by: the heroic statues (`izBronze`, `izBronzeCyl`, `izBronzeD` on `MAT.bronze`, `bronzeDark`) and the embassy's
  `vpGilt` and `vpBrass`. Stands in today: plain metal (`metal.bronze` is a riveted, seamed panel: wrong on a cast
  figure). Reuse: Ys' Citadel spires (`hkVerd`, now the riveted `metal.bronze.verdigris`; a plain patina suits them
  better), any statue, bell or cast fitting.

#### `concrete.rust.streaked.sea`
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 30.webp. Wired: settlements/ys `concreteR`.
- Kind: tileable material, full colour (not tinted); one tile = 8 m across and 8 m up; the streaks run strictly down.
  (`MATERIAL-PROMPTS.md` names it `concrete.rust.streaked`; renamed here because Iziz's tintable inland version, section 1,
  holds that id. If one image is to serve both, deliver Iziz's and tint it rusty on Ys.)
- Used by: the ruined concrete of the Monolith, the Warden and the stumps (`MAT.concreteR`) and the Conocylinder stumps'
  rust skin (`MAT.rust`). Stands in today: `concrete.ancient` (clean board marks) and the procedural rust.

The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Board-formed grey concrete of a tall ruined tower, seen face-on, weathered for centuries beside the sea: long rust streaks running straight down the face from rows of corroded fixings and rebar ends, orange-brown bleeding into dark brown, between them pale salt bloom and grey-green algae staining, small spalls where the concrete has broken off round rusting bars, hairline cracks, the board marks still faintly visible. The streaks run strictly vertical (down the image) so the tile can run up a wall. Keep the base concrete a muted mid grey and the rust a muted orange-brown, with no single streak so distinct that it would repeat visibly on a 300 m tower.

- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 2.webp. Wired: settlements/highlands `formF`, the frieze boards of every branch (a 0.5 m panel).
- Kind: pattern sheet, full colour, repeats horizontally. Highlands' Tribal (Northwest-coast) branch; the catalog's
  `Painted` formline colours. Listed "prompted earlier and still owed" in `PLAN.md` (catalog audit). **Check:**
  `patterns/republic/folk-formline-a`/`-b` and the friezes `patterns/highlands/frieze-nw-totemic`, `frieze-asian-nw` may
  already serve. A white-ground variant: swap the cedar ground for white (#efe7d6).

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Flat, front-on decorative panel of Northwest-coast formline painting on cedar: bold swelling black (#171311) formlines with ovoids and U-shapes, the inner shapes in red (#b3322a) and teal (#2e9488), on a cedar-wood ground (#b27a4c, shading to #8a5634), hand-painted and slightly worn, the wood grain faintly showing. Abstract: no readable figures. The pattern repeats horizontally. Full colour.
```

#### `patterns/highlands/caihua`
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 1.webp (three bands; one installed). Wired: settlements/highlands `hCaihua`, mapped once per bay. The four friezes stay unused.
- Kind: pattern sheet, a long band about 8:1, full colour, repeats horizontally. Highlands' painted beams. **Check:** the
  four wide friezes delivered 2026-10-03 (`frieze-asian-nw`, `frieze-teal-gold`, `frieze-cloud-lotus`,
  `frieze-nw-totemic`) were filed as caihua candidates and are not used yet; if one reads as caihua, wire it instead.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Flat, front-on decorative panel of a Chinese painted beam (caihua), a long horizontal band about eight times wider than tall: ground blue (#3a6aa8) with green (#3f7a4a) stripes along the top and bottom edges. At each end a teal (#2e9488) block holding a large whorl-flower of concentric rings in white (#efe7d6), teal, blue and ochre (#d19a3a), with black (#201a18) petal scrolls and a smaller whorl either side. In the middle a long white-edged panel with pointed ends, red (#b3322a) inside, filled with six ochre cloud scrolls; ochre dots at the joints and a thin black outline. The pattern repeats horizontally. Full colour, painted.
```

#### `wool.fleece`
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 33.webp. Wired: kits/fauna `fleece`, the sheep's wool. `surface.fleece` stays the eastern highlands' woolly plants (it was never on the fauna).
- Kind: tileable material, near-colourless. Fauna: sheep, yak undercoat, goat kids; reuse fleece rugs, felt, saddle
  pads. **Check:** `surface.fleece` (delivered for the eastern highlands' woolly plants, reuse "sheepskin, felt, any
  woolly plant or animal coat") may serve.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Sheep's fleece on the living animal seen close up: dense crimped wool staples about 5 cm long packed side by side, each a twisted lock with a slightly darker weathered tip, small dark gaps between the locks, a few bits of dry grass caught in it. Off-white, evenly muted. Keep colours natural but slightly muted and even, so the texture can be tinted to different palettes without looking stained.
```

#### `card.grass.panic`
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 29.webp (nine base-anchored tufts). Wired: biomes/geyser `grass`, grey under the panic grass palette. The reeds stay procedural.
- Kind: cut-out card sheet, 3 x 3 on magenta, near-grey green (tinted); **base on the bottom edge of each cell**. New
  prompt. `biomes/geyser/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: "the grass and the reeds are procedural: the library's grass and reed cards are
  centre-anchored, and the kit's tufts stand on the card's bottom edge. A base-anchored panic-grass card would do."
  **Check:** `card.grass.dry` (asked for "standing up from the bottom of each cell") may already be base-anchored. The
  reeds want the same fix (`card.reed`).

```
A sheet of nine separate cut-out plant sprites in a 3x3 grid on a solid flat magenta background (#ff00ff), square, 2048x2048, nothing crossing into the next cell. Front-on, orthographic, flat even shadowless lighting, no cast shadows, no ground, no text. Each sprite: a tuft of panic grass, a loose fountain of narrow soft blades arching outward and a few open airy seed panicles on thin stems, the tuft's base sitting exactly on the bottom edge of its cell (not floating in the middle), its top reaching about nine tenths of the cell's height; vary the height, the spread and the number of panicles between the nine. Plain muted grey-green so the sprites can be tinted. Hard clean edges against the magenta, no anti-aliased fringe of other colours. No magenta, pink or purple anywhere in the subject; no grey or white background.
```

#### `patterns/scyvoi/salamander-ember` and `patterns/scyvoi/salamander-dun`
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 28.webp (ember) and 26.webp (`patterns/scyvoi/salamander-dun`). Wired: kits/fauna `salEmber`, `salDun`, a new FULL-colour slot in the runtime, by variant.
- Kind: pattern sheets, full colour, repeat both ways. New prompts. `kits/fauna/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: the salamander's
  markings are vertex colours on 16-sided rings and read blocky up close; "a painted skin sheet would be finer". Colours
  from `faSalSkin` (`kits/fauna/krator-fauna-mounts.js`). **Check:** the fauna kit maps grey detail sets under vertex
  colours and has no hook for a full-colour skin; the salamander needs UVs and a slot first.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: The back skin of a giant fire salamander seen from above: smooth, moist, slightly glossy skin with fine pores and soft wrinkles, no scales and no hair, fire-black (#161414) with irregular rounded blotches of ember orange (#f07418) and amber (#f4a020) of different sizes, some merging into short broken stripes running along the body, the blotches' edges soft. The pattern repeats in both directions. Full colour.
```

Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: The back skin of a giant fire salamander seen from above: smooth, moist, slightly glossy skin with fine pores and soft wrinkles, no scales and no hair, dun red-brown (#5a2414) crossed by regular narrow bands of saffron (#d8a028) and gold (#e8c040) running across the body, the bands slightly broken and uneven at their ends. The bands run left to right across the image. The pattern repeats in both directions. Full colour.
```

#### `patterns/iziz/sun-banner` (a periodic redo)
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 27.webp: repeats exactly (two periods each way). Replaced the old sheet; kits/mechs tiles it now (mechs-runtime.js).
- Kind: pattern sheet, full colour, must repeat exactly. `kits/mechs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: the delivered sheet "is not
  periodic"; banners show a window from one tile, so one wider than 1.8 m or taller than 1.3 m would clamp. **Check:** no
  banner is that large today. The first prompt was not kept verbatim (`chatgpt-2026-10g-mechs.json` records its gist);
  this one is rebuilt from it.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Flat, front-on decorative panel of hand-woven Iziz banner cloth with a visible plain weave, slightly faded and uneven dye: cream (#f1dba6) sixteen-rayed suns in a half-drop grid on Iziz orange (#e07a2a), each sun outlined in deep red (#9c2d2d), with teal (#2f8f8a) stripes running along the top and bottom of each row of suns. Exactly two suns across and two rows down, so the sheet repeats exactly in both directions. Full colour.
```

#### `patterns/common/grime-streaks`
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 32.webp: 20 x 8 cells on white (the prompt asked 16 x 8 on transparent). Installed only: the breakup hook's grime parameter is not built.
- Kind: a mask atlas, greyscale, 16 cells across by 8 down (each cell twice as tall as wide). New prompt (`PLAN.md`,
  "Culture pattern sheets", Shared; `TODO.md`: "One generated image; prompt to write in PLAN.md"). Each opening, sill or
  cornice picks a cell by hash. **Check:** the `grime` parameter on `breakup` that reads it is not built yet.

```
A sheet of 128 separate grime streak masks in a grid of 16 columns by 8 rows, square, 2048x2048, each cell twice as tall as it is wide, on a solid flat pure white background. Front-on, flat, even, shadowless lighting; no text, no border, no grid lines. Each cell holds one vertical stain as on a wall below a window sill or a cornice: it starts at the top edge of its cell as a soft band and runs down, fading out before the bottom edge, nothing crossing into the next cell. Vary them: soot, damp, rust run-off, narrow drips, wide washes, single, forked and several parallel runs, some short, some long. Greyscale only, from pale grey to near-black where the stain is strongest, no colour at all.
```

#### `patterns/reedlake/reed-lattice` (cut-out)
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 5.webp. `patterns/reedlake/reed-lattice`, an alpha cut-out. Wired: settlements/reedlake `rlLattice`.
- Kind: cut-out pattern sheet on magenta, full colour, repeats both ways. The mudhif fronts' open diamond lattice
  (`MAT.rlLattice`, `74-rl-mat.js`); `PLAN.md` "Reed Lake" prompted it on a dark key and it never came. **Check:** the
  procedural alpha lattice works and no known issue asks for it; the cut-outs stay procedural because the delivered reed
  sheets are opaque, so this is only worth it on magenta.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Flat, front-on decorative panel of an open diamond lattice, like the front of a reed mudhif: flat reed strips crossing diagonally at 45 degrees in both directions, spaced so the gaps are square diamonds that show a solid flat bright magenta (#ff00ff) background, so the lattice can be cut out. One set of strips is straw gold (#c9b06a), the other slightly darker (#b89c5a). A thin dark brown shadow line (#3c2814) runs along one edge of each strip. No magenta, pink or purple anywhere in the strips. The pattern repeats in both directions. Full colour.
```

#### `patterns/reedlake/fringe` (a cut-out redo)
- **Delivered 2026-10-14:** 3.webp. The cut-out redo replaced `patterns/reedlake/fringe`. Wired: settlements/reedlake `rlFringe`.
- Kind: cut-out pattern sheet on magenta, full colour, repeats horizontally. The delivered `fringe` is on a dark ground
  and opaque, so the eave fringe (`MAT.rlFringe`) stays procedural. **Check:** as the lattice above.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, a flat, front-on decorative panel filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: Flat, front-on decorative panel of loose reed ends hanging from an eave: about seventy thin, slightly curved strands, each hanging straight down from the top edge. Lengths are uneven, between half and full height. Each strand leans a little to one side. The strands are pale straw (#cbb36e) or darker straw (#b39c5c), spread randomly on a solid flat bright magenta (#ff00ff) background, so they can be cut out. The strands end ragged and loose. No magenta, pink or purple anywhere in the strands. The pattern repeats horizontally. Full colour.

## Gaps with no prompt yet

## 4. Crops kit (the next batch, 2026-10-18)

The first twelve prompts of this section and seven of the next eight were delivered on 2026-10-18 (see "Delivered" below). Still owed: the indigo, for the dye crops (`kits/crops/DYES.md`). Reused, so not owed: `card.mushroom.alecap` and `card.mushroom.glow`, `card.sword` (Socotran sisal), `card.paddle` (Rope banana), `card.orchard.broad` (Vale mulberry), `card.broom` (heath broom), `card.ghostwood` and `card.ironbark` (ghost-gum leaf), `card.reef` (reef teal) and the Throne's own `mat`.

One cut-out sheet left. One image per block; every sprite stands on the bottom of its cell.

#### `card.crop.indigo`
- Kind: cut-out card sheet, 3 x 3 on magenta, full colour; one plant per cell.
- Used by: Jungle indigo (blue dye). Reuse: indigo and any pinnate-leaved dye shrub or vine.

```
A sheet of nine separate cut-out plant sprites in a 3x3 grid on a solid flat magenta background (#ff00ff), square, 2048x2048, each sprite centred in its cell with magenta all round it and nothing crossing into the next cell. Front-on, orthographic, flat even shadowless lighting, no cast shadows, no ground, no text. Each sprite: a leafy sprig of an indigo shrub: a slim green stem carrying fine feathery pinnate leaves of many small oval blue-green (#4f8a6a) leaflets, small clusters of pale cream pea flowers at the leaf joints and, hanging, a few slim curved brown seed pods; vary the number of pods and flowers between the nine. Full colour: not tinted. Hard clean edges against the magenta, no anti-aliased fringe of other colours. No magenta, pink or purple anywhere in the subject; no grey or white background.
```

## 5. Pinnacle Rock (`settlements/pinnacle-rock`, 2026-10-18)

The Beast Rider roost town's red sandstone mesa and its Garden-of-the-Gods pinnacles (`settlements/pinnacle-rock/PLAN.md`
section 2; the owner asked for the set, 2026-10-18). The library's `rock.sandstone.navajo` (sweeping cross-beds) is
reused for the fins' faces; what is missing is the **horizontally bedded** red stone of the balanced rocks and the mesa's
walls. One image. Lands in `core/materials/library/`, the family in `settlements/pinnacle-rock/materials.json` and the
rock-stack generator's bed material.

#### `rock.sandstone.bedded.red`
- Kind: tileable material, full colour; 4 m tile (the beds are decimetres to a metre thick, so a tile shows four to
  eight of them). Garden of the Gods, Fountain formation: coarse, pebbly, horizontally bedded red sandstone.
- Reuse: any red-bed cliff or butte (the desert's mesas beside `rock.sandstone.navajo`, Shade's lower cliffs, the Rift's
  mesa ridges), tinted a step warmer or cooler by the build.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic front-on view of a vertical rock face, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: A cliff face of coarse, pebbly red sandstone in horizontal beds, like Garden of the Gods: six or seven beds across the image, each a decimetre to half a metre thick, separated by thin recessed partings that run level across the whole width; the beds alternate between brick red (#a8503a), salmon pink (#c98468) and a paler pinkish buff (#d9b091), with scattered pea-sized pebbles and grit standing proud of the surface, a few small honeycomb weathering pits, and faint darker water streaks (#6a3a2c) running down from one or two partings. Rough, matte, granular surface; no cross-bedding, no vegetation, no sky.
```

## 6. The Throne's new flora (`biomes/throne`, 2026-10-18)

`biomes/throne/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`: "The new flora of station 1 and the ash desert is procedural" (`HANDOFF-FLORA.md`, refs
21-31). Each set lands in `core/materials/library/<id>/`; add its slot to `biomes/throne/materials.json` (the kit's
`libMap` and `cardsOf` read it), re-pack, rebuild station 1 and the ash desert. Reuse first, not owed: the chalice
parasol's stalk can take `bark.ghostwood` or `bark.smooth`, the moss domes `ground.moss001`, the geode shells any grey
rock in the library. The braid cap is purple, so it stays on the parasol cap skin (`cap.disc`) tinted: a purple
cut-out cannot be keyed off magenta.

#### `card.fan.lace`
- Kind: cut-out card sheet, 3 x 3 on magenta, full colour; one fan per cell.
- Used by: the lace-fan tree's brackets (`lacefan`, now a canvas cut-out). Reuse: any perforated fungal fan or bracket.

```
A sheet of nine separate cut-out sprites in a 3x3 grid on a solid flat magenta background (#ff00ff), square, 2048x2048, each sprite centred in its cell with magenta all round it and nothing crossing into the next cell. Front-on, orthographic, flat even shadowless lighting, no cast shadows, no ground, no text. Each sprite: one fan-shaped fungal bracket seen face-on, a half disc widening from a narrow root at the bottom middle of the cell to a lobed, ruffled upper rim, made of a lace of branching veins with open holes between them like a leaf skeleton, the veins pale glowing cream-white (#f4e8d0) at the root warming to orange (#e88040) and deep orange (#d06020) at the rim, the holes fully open to the magenta behind; vary the width, the lobing and the density of the lace between the nine. Full colour: not tinted. Hard clean edges against the magenta, no anti-aliased fringe of other colours. No magenta, pink or purple anywhere in the subject; no grey or white background.
```

#### `card.blade.pyre`
- Kind: cut-out card sheet, 3 x 3 on magenta, full colour; one blade per cell.
- Used by: the pyre thistle's blades (`pyreblade`, now vertex colour). Reuse: any black spiked rosette.

```
A sheet of nine separate cut-out sprites in a 3x3 grid on a solid flat magenta background (#ff00ff), square, 2048x2048, each sprite centred in its cell with magenta all round it and nothing crossing into the next cell. Front-on, orthographic, flat even shadowless lighting, no cast shadows, no ground, no text. Each sprite: one long leathery blade standing upright from the bottom of the cell to a sharp point at the top, like a flame or an agave leaf, its edges cut in hooked saw teeth, near-black (#1a1414) with a faint sheen, and up its middle a vein pattern glowing ember orange (#e0501a) and hot orange (#f06a2a) that branches into fine veins and fades out before the tip; vary the width, the curve and the teeth between the nine. Full colour: not tinted. Hard clean edges against the magenta, no anti-aliased fringe of other colours. No magenta, pink or purple anywhere in the subject; no grey or white background.
```

#### `organic.lattice.cage`
- Kind: tileable surface with its holes in magenta (keyed to alpha), full colour.
- Used by: the cage lantern's bulb (`cagebulb`, now a canvas lattice). Reuse: any open chitin or coral cage.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: an organic lattice like a Voronoi cage of chitin: smooth rounded struts a few centimetres thick, glossy red-orange (#c84020) with darker red (#a02818) in the joints and paler orange (#d85a2a) along the strut tops, enclosing packed round and oval holes of varied size, each hole filled with solid flat magenta (#ff00ff); about twelve holes across the tile. Full colour. No magenta anywhere but inside the holes.
```

#### `organic.coil.ribbed`
- Kind: tileable surface, full colour (it wraps the coil horns' tubes, u round them).
- Used by: coil horns (`coilhorn`, now the banded bark `bark5` under vertex colour).

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: the skin of a huge ribbed tubular plant, close parallel ribs running straight across the image from left to right, about sixteen ribs to the tile, waxy yellow (#c8b830) with paler yellow (#d4c440) on the rib crests, mottled in patches and streaks with olive-green (#4a5a22) and near-black (#1e2410) mould that gathers in the grooves between the ribs. Full colour.
```

#### `organic.cap.medusa`
- Kind: tileable surface, full colour, mapped from above on the cap (planar).
- Used by: the medusa cap's dome (now the parasol cap skin `cap.disc`, tinted maroon).

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark. The left edge must continue into the right edge and the top into the bottom. Material: the glossy skin of a giant mushroom cap, smooth and wet-looking, deep maroon (#4a1218) with patches of darker wine (#3a0e14) and dull red (#5a1a20), scattered with small round pale cream (#e8dcc8) spots and flecks of varied size. Full colour. Matte apart from a soft even sheen, no specular highlights.
```

#### `ground.moss.crimson`
- Kind: tileable surface, full colour.
- Used by: the red velvet on station 1's acid shores (`velvet`, now the lichen card tinted crimson). Reuse: any red moss carpet.

```
Seamless tileable texture, square, 2048x2048. Orthographic top-down view, perfectly flat surface filling the whole frame edge to edge. Flat, even, shadowless lighting, as if scanned: no highlights, no vignette, no shading gradient across the image. No perspective, no objects, no text, no border, no watermark.

Material: a dense velvety carpet of tiny crimson moss, short soft cushions packed together with fine hair-like tips, deep crimson (#9a1a22) and red (#b02430) with darker wine (#6e1218) in the hollows between the cushions and a few paler red (#c84040) tips. Full colour.
```

## Delivered 2026-10-18, crops

Twelve prompts delivered (13 pasted images; the owner's numbering): `card.crop.plume`, `card.crop.clover`, `card.crop.bean`, `card.crop.grainhead`, `card.crop.rosette`, `card.crop.umbrella` (came as a papaya-like spotted trunk with a cut-leaf crown; kept), `card.orchard.broad`, `card.crop.tea`, `card.sunthorn`, `card.orchard.small`, `card.crop.palmate` and `ground.tilled`, all in `core/materials/library/` (batches `crops-2026-10-18-cards.json`, `crops-2026-10-18-ground.json`). **Not wired:** the crops kit is not built yet; no `materials.json` names them. The grain and plume cards carry a faint pink spill (they are tintable, so the tint covers it). One extra image (grey-silver leaf sprays with a pink fringe, image 11) was not used: it duplicates `card.orchard.small`.

Second delivery 2026-10-18 (images 14 to 21; batch `crops-2026-10-18-cards2.json`): `card.crop.flax`, `card.crop.nettle`, `card.crop.cotton`, `card.mushroom.pale`, `card.crop.annatto` (two takes came; the second, image 19, is installed, the first, image 18, is unused), `card.crop.woad`, `card.crop.saffron` (lilac-white as asked; keyed with `spill: edge` to keep the lilac). Not wired, as above.

Owed, but a prompt needs work first; listed so they are not lost.

- **The Ring Sea isles' crop leaves** (`biomes/ringisles`): the banana's (`card.paddle` has banana leaves, but diagonal in their cells), rice and cane blades as standing clumps, and greens. Each needs a card framed upright in its cell.
- **Catalog hangings for Eastern Abyss, Lizardmen and Screamer** (`PLAN.md`, catalog audit, "No pattern sheet at all"):
  the kit's canvas painters work; each culture needs a style read of its culture file before a prompt is written.
- **The shared `detail.*` sets** (plaster grain, stone grain, metal brush) for the `detail` record field (`PLAN.md`, "From
  spiderbench"; `TODO.md`): the field is not built.
- **The Iziz Vernacular's trade surfaces** (`settlements/iziz`, the trades round, 2026-10-16): a plain dyed cloth in
  undyed weave (the weaver's and tailor's lengths are the tarp tinted; `vCloth` is the striped awning map), still water for
  the mill race and the moat landings (tinted glass today), and a world-UV rough rock for the mine's and quarry's crags (the
  shared `rubble` item stretches). Each needs a read of the drawing first: which items carry it, and at what tile.
- **The Throne's drawn details** (`PLAN.md`, The Throne): the mat's veins, the star aloe's star, the trumpet tree's
  funnels, the lamp caps' dishes, the frill pods stay procedural; none has been framed as a texture.

## Stale notes found in the sweep (already delivered)

- `biomes/ehighlands/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` still says `ground.puna` is not delivered: it is (`library/ground.puna`).
- `biomes/throne/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` (the geyser isle) still points at the sinter and mat gaps: `ground.sinter` and
  `ground.mat.thermal` are in the library.
- `TODO.md`'s Girder "four texture gaps (leafy, web, ghostwood, prism gum)": three have sets in `girder/materials.json`;
  the web stays procedural by choice (`PLAN.md`, Girder hookup).
- `settlements/ys/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` says the Ancient towers' `MAT.white` has "no prompt": it binds to `metal.ancient.white`
  since 2026-10-06; the rust is section 2 above.
- `feather.plumage` is delivered but `kits/fauna/materials.json` has no `feather` family yet (wiring, not an image).
