# Krator: to do

A working list. Items marked *(Menagerie)* come from reading the World Menagerie embedded at
`host/WorldMenagerie/` (paths below are under it). Its code is read for ideas only: anything taken is
rewritten as a Krator fragment, never imported from `host/` (`tools/check_insulation.py`).

**Godot tags.** The plan (`biomes/WORLD.md`) is that three.js generates and previews, and Godot runs the open
world. The port works when **what** a thing is (data) is kept apart from **how** three.js draws it
(`biomes/GODOT.md`, `core/atmos/GODOT.md`). Each item is tagged:

- **[G data]** engine-neutral: an algorithm or data that crosses over through the exporters as it is. This is
  the most valuable kind; do these as data first, drawing second.
- **[G shader]** a shader trick that rewrites directly into a `.gdshader` (often through the global shader
  parameters `core/atmos/GODOT.md` already defines).
- **[G native]** Godot has this built in. Worth doing in three.js only for the preview; don't port it.
- **[web]** browser or three.js only. No Godot value.

Prefer items that are straightforward to port. **Godot order:** (1) the carver's floor and blocker list,
which becomes collision shapes and the navigation mesh source; (2) the land-cover map, which becomes the
terrain splat texture and the placement input; (3) the minimap drawn from exported data.

**Counts:** about 15 [G data], 8 [G shader], 9 [G native] and 12 [web].

## Features

- **Minimap** *(Menagerie: `src/moria/walk.js:130-149`)* **[G data]**. A 2D canvas panel, drawn from data
  rather than from the rendered scene. A base layer is painted once into an offscreen canvas: every walkable
  floor, sorted by height so upper levels cover lower, coloured by level, with labels. Each update (at most
  4 Hz, only while the panel is open) copies the base layer and draws the viewer's dot and view wedge.
  Hovering names the floor under the pointer; clicking walks there.
  - For Krator: a shared `core/` fragment that paints from each build's `PLACED` list (footprint, rotation,
    tag) plus hill shading sampled from `terrainH()`, and water. Colour by tag, click to fly or walk.
    Start with Voth, whose `PLACED` list is already exposed (`settlements/voth/src/85-probe.js:73`).
  - Godot: the same records drawn in a `Control._draw()`, almost line for line. Better still, bake the base
    layer to a PNG at export time and ship it with the tile.
  - Optional: a one-time overhead orthographic bake to a texture as the background, for the painted look.
    Hide the sky, fog and inspector helpers during the bake.

## Underground and interiors *(Menagerie: Moria)*

- **[G data] The carver registers walkable floors and blockers as it builds** (`src/moria/carve.js`).
  `room()` and `passage()` write `{rect,y}` or `{a,b,w}` floors and `[x0,x1,z0,z1,y0,y1]` blocks as they
  build. The walker, the minimap and click-to-go all read that one list, so they can never disagree with the
  geometry. Krator's walk solids (girder `83-walk.js`) and its geometry are kept separately. In Godot the
  same list becomes collision shapes and a navigation mesh source; export it next to the geometry.
- **[G data] Walls are built split round their openings**, not cut afterwards: each wall is pieces left of,
  below, above and right of each opening (`carve.js:28-36`). No CSG is needed, and no hidden faces. The
  geometry exports as it is.
- **[G native] Draw underground only when you are under ground** (`src/moria/deep.js:15-24`). Everything built
  after a marker goes into one group. That group is drawn only when the camera is below the terrain or near
  a gate, and the terrain is hidden while you are under. It saved a laptop from crashing. Screamers' vaults
  and the dam tunnels could use this. Godot: occluders and visibility ranges do this, but the group toggle is
  one line if wanted.
- **[G data] Fade to dark underground, and carry a lantern** (`deep.js:26-41`): ease a 0-to-1 "under" value.
  Scale the sun, hemisphere and ambient down from the values the day/night code just set, close the fog in to
  black, and move a camera lantern that already exists at intensity 0. Lights are never added or removed,
  because that recompiles every material. Export the "under" volumes and the curve; Godot drives its
  Environment the same way.
- **[G native] Three moving lights for a whole city** (`src/moria/realm.js:31-44`). There are a few point
  lights, moved four times a second to the nearest of a list of light spots. Hundreds of lamp heads are one
  InstancedMesh of unlit material. Godot's Forward+ renderer handles many lights; the pool still matters on the
  Mobile and Compatibility renderers. Export the light spots either way.
- **[G shader] Shafts of daylight without lights** (`src/moria/halls.js:163-172`): an additive open cone from
  the window to the floor, an additive pool on the floor, and a bright sky card behind the opening.
- **[G shader] "See inside": the mountain as glass** (`deep.js:46`): terrain at opacity 0.18 with depth write
  off. Hidden features (the Endless Stair) are drawn only in that mode.
- **[G native] Polished stone underground uses Phong** (per pixel) so lantern light runs in the walls. Lambert
  is per vertex and loses a small light on big planes. Godot shading is always per pixel.
- **[G data] One switch for lit and dark states** (`src/moria/city.js:259-262`): a whole city changes from
  inhabited to ruined by swapping colours and emissive intensity, never geometry. This fits Krator's ruins and
  inhabited variants. Export both palettes.
- **[G data] The generator checks that every hall is covered by rock** (`tools/make-moria.py:20`). This could
  be an assert in `verify.py` for carved builds; run on the export, it guards the Godot side too.

## Interiors *(Menagerie: the Backrooms, `src/backrooms/`)*

Krator's interiors planner (`kits/interiors/src/46-planner.js`) already splits a floor plate, cuts openings
and outputs walls, doors and a room graph, so the layout side is covered. What the Backrooms adds is about
making many rooms look lived-in cheaply.

- **[G data] Light baked into vertex colours** (`level.js:216-241`). Every surface is cut into a grid of about
  0.6 m. Each vertex adds up the ceiling panels within 7 m that it can see. Visibility is a 2D walk along the
  grid lines, so light goes through doorways and walls cast shadow. A direct term and a soft fill term are
  clamped to 1.7. The cost is nothing per frame and no real lights. Godot's LightmapGI cannot bake rooms
  generated at runtime, so export the colours as mesh `COLOR`. Use it for furnished rooms, with the catalog's
  lamps as sources.
- **[G shader] Per-lamp flicker without lights** (`level.js:176-188`, `:437`). Each vertex stores how much of
  its light comes from a flickering panel and that panel's phase (attribute `aF`). The shader dims by
  `share·(1−flick(t,phase))`, so the wall flickers with the lamp. Lamp state is on, dead or flickering.
- **[G data] Grime from world-space noise, not in the texture** (`textures.js:7-9`, `level.js:243-252`).
  Textures are one clean repeat at real size (wallpaper 1.2 × 3 m, a ceiling tile 1.2 × 0.6 m). Stains, damp
  creeping up walls and puddles go in vertex colours from fbm over world position, so no stain repeats.
  Stains tint brown rather than grey. This fits every Krator interior and ruin.
- **[G data] Room-variety rules as numbers, one generator per level** (`level.js:28-51`):
  - the chance two rooms merge, leaving columns where the wall would be;
  - partial walls that stop short;
  - one-door versus full-width openings;
  - weighted ceiling heights, with narrow halls more often low;
  - a lighting mode per room: full, alternate, dim or dark, with rates for dead and flickering panels;
  - lamp colour, ambient light and fog.
  Office, car park and pool hall are one generator with three presets. Worth adding to the interiors
  programmes as a `variety` block.
- **[G data] Streaming interior chunks from the seed** (already listed under Worlds): each chunk boundary
  forces one opening, so neighbours always connect.
- **[G shader] Pool caustics** (`level.js:199-213`): two crossed sine fields, `pow(|a+b|·0.6, 3)` for the
  bright lines. Ten lines; useful for baths, cisterns and fountains.
- **[G data] Procedural ambient sound** (`sound.js`): mains hum as a 120 Hz sawtooth through a band-pass, a
  60 Hz square, a high whine and hiss, all slowly modulated. Each level swaps the recipe. The parameters
  port to Godot's `AudioStreamGenerator`; the Web Audio code is [web].

## Fixes *(Menagerie runtime)*

- **[web]** Recover from a lost WebGL context: `preventDefault` on `webglcontextlost`, show a panel, restore.
  No Krator build does this (`src/core/shell.js:31-43`). One place for it is `gallery/krator-bar.js` `tune()`.
- **[web]** Isolate errors per subsystem in the frame loop. In Voth, `updateLife`, `skyAdvance` and the HUD
  sit outside the try (`settlements/voth/src/80-camera.js:303-319`), so one throw means it never draws again.
- **[web]** Input guards: clear held keys and pointers on blur and on hidden tabs; end a pointer when
  `buttons===0`; ignore keys while typing (`src/core/input.js`).
- **[web]** Leave a cut plane installed and park it at `constant=1e7`, instead of swapping `clippingPlanes`
  and recompiling (`settlements/yuni/src/76-doors.js:259`, `kits/interiors/src-walk/70-walk.js:213`).
- **[web]** Call `renderer.compile(scene,camera)` before hiding the loader.
- **[web]** Redraw the shadow map only when the target moves or the sun turns.
- **[G native]** Adaptive resolution (detail before pixels, remember a ratio that failed, hysteresis). Godot
  has resolution scaling built in; the controller logic would carry over if it is ever needed there.

## Rendering ideas *(Menagerie)*

- **[G shader]** Cloud shadows and rain darkening through one shared shader chunk (`src/core/env.js:102-118`).
  Godot: a shared `.gdshaderinc` over the `atm_*` globals; apply the cloud shade in `light()`.
- **[G shader]** Lit windows as an emissive texture for massed and distant facades
  (`src/engine/stages/03-blocks.js`).
- **[G shader]** Lamp schedules computed per instance on the GPU (`env.js:82,192-197`). This matches
  `core/atmos/GODOT.md`, which already puts hours in `INSTANCE_CUSTOM`.
- **[G native]** A dithered fade before LOD drops an object (`env.js:170-181`). Godot's visibility range has a
  dithered fade mode.
- **[G shader]** Fill a cut solid by drawing its back faces as flat hatching (`src/blame/mats.js:166-176`).
  Godot: `FRONT_FACING` in a `.gdshader`.
- **[G native]** A per-frame bounding sphere for movers, so off-screen herds and boats are culled. Godot: a
  MultiMesh `custom_aabb`.
- **[web]** One shared polygon-offset ladder. **[G data]** A shared mitred ribbon helper for roads, rivers and
  walls, whose output is plain geometry.

## Worlds *(Menagerie)*

These are the best Godot candidates: generators whose output is data.

- **[G data]** One land-cover map per world, read by both the ground shader and plant placement
  (`tools/make-yellowstone.py:457-575`, `src/yellowstone/nature.js`). In Godot it is a splat texture for the
  terrain shader and the input to placement.
- **[G data]** A warped-lattice field and hedgerow generator for the highlands and lowlands
  (`tools/make-shire.py:152-178`).
- **[G data]** Mountain height functions: range walls, junctions that don't double up, volcano cones
  (`tools/make-mordor.py:84-181`).
- **[G shader]** Distant mountain ranges drawn at their true angular size as a backdrop
  (`src/minastirith/shadow.js`). A seamless open world may not want it, except for ranges beyond the map.
- **[G data] + [G shader]** River foam driven by slope (stored per vertex), and a water surface that never
  climbs downstream (`src/rivendell/water.js`, `src/isengard/isen.js`).
- **[G native]** Pull a buried camera back along its line of sight (`src/blame/main.js:115-142`): Godot has
  SpringArm3D. A circle walker with corner push-out (`src/backrooms/level.js:395-419`), and a lift you can
  ride: CharacterBody3D does both, platform motion included.
- **[G data]** Chunks generated from the seed alone, with doors forced at chunk edges
  (`src/backrooms/level.js`). This is the same tile-by-tile loading `biomes/WORLD.md` plans.
- **[G data]** Timed set pieces as pure functions of t, publishing signals on a bus (`src/fleshpit/incident.js`).

## Lava *(Menagerie: the fire on Kharak, `src/homeworld/kharak.js:15-61`)*

Krator has no molten lava. swbay's flows are cold vertex colours (`biomes/swbay/src/45-host-stage.js:231-236`),
and its plume is a chain of spheres.

- **[G shader] A lava field shader.** Kharak's fire is a single fragment shader, with no particles. Fire fronts
  are a thin band where a drifting fbm crosses 0.5. A finer front drifts the other way. Embers come from a
  high-frequency fbm, only on the burnt side. A `burn` 0..1 uniform blends the whole effect in. To make it lava:
  - sample world xz in metres, using a tiled 3D noise texture rather than `fract(sin())`, which loses
    precision at world scale;
  - drive the drift with a downslope flow map, blended in two phases, instead of one constant drift;
  - put fronts and embers in emission so they glow at night and bloom (Godot: WorldEnvironment glow);
  - put voronoi plates under the front band, so the cooling crust reads as plates and cracks;
  - drive it from `atm_time`, and ease `burn` per second, not per frame.
  A Godot sketch is about ten lines (`EMISSION` from the front band and the embers). It suits lava lakes and
  fields; channel flows need the flow map.
- **[G data]** The numbers become an atmos preset: `{kind:'lavafield', scale, flow, frontW, colours, burn}`.
- **[G native]** Sparks and steam: GPUParticles3D, with parameters taken from `src/core/dust.js:13-52` (drag,
  gravity, wind, life, alpha curve). The steam is atmos's existing `smoke` steam preset.

## Effects: new core/atmos fx kinds *(Menagerie sci-fi scenes)*

Every Menagerie particle effect is stepped on the processor. Take the parameters, not the code: Godot's
GPUParticles3D, FogVolume and Decal read them directly.

- **[G data] → [G native] `jet`:** ballistic grains under gravity alone (`src/europa/grains.js:18-45`,
  `src/europa/ice.js:163-185`). It starts full, because each grain is placed at a random point along its arc
  (Godot: `preprocess`). Presets `plume` and `vent`, with g as a parameter.
- **[G data] → [G native] `dustburst` plus a `dust` weather mode:** velocity relaxes toward the wind with drag
  (`src/core/dust.js:13`). The Coriolis storm front (`src/arrakeen/events.js:81-96`) crosses at 110 m/s; as it
  passes, fog goes to ×90 and dust brown, the sun to ×0.15, with static flashes. Godot: a moving FogVolume
  plus Environment fog. `ATMOS.W` has no dust mode today.
- **[G data] → [G native] `burst`:** explosion and impact: a flash, a flat ring, sparks and a scar left on the
  ground (`src/homeworld/fleet.js:96-110`, `src/europa/events.js:107-121`). Godot: one-shot particles and a
  Decal. Krator has no explosions.
- **[G data] `exhaust`:** an engine glow disc plus a plume cone, with drive-state presets taken from Voyager's
  warp sequence (`src/voyager/ship.js:246-283`: idle, hot, flare). Trails: GPUParticles3D trails.
- **[G shader] `portal`:** counter-rotating spiral discs, opening as `sin^0.6` (`src/babylon5/station.js:735-760`).
- **[G native] `airbox`:** a haze box (`src/blame/city.js:113-124`); in Godot, a box FogVolume.
- **[G data] `sign`:** text, colour, size and pulse (`src/nightcity/neon.js`); in Godot, a `Label3D` with
  emission, its halo in `glow`.
- **[G data] An `events` export block:** a random-event scheduler with `every:[min,max]` and an `active()`
  gate (`src/core/happenings.js:19,73`).
- Sky module, not atmos, **[G shader]**:
  - drifting cloud bands on the gas giant, from the latitude-stretched, drifting fbm cloud shell
    (`src/homeworld/kharak.js:68-83`); the giant's rim already exists. No night-side city lights: it is a gas
    giant;
  - a galactic band in the star field (`kharak.js:92+`);
  - a rotating-habitat sky: an axial sun tube that dims rather than sets, with land overhead
    (`src/hab/world.js:40-63,357-368,539-560,622-650`).

## Life layer: motion as a function of time *(Menagerie ship behaviour)*

Voth's life layer is integrated state. Ships cycle docked, away, arriving and departing, with avoidance nudges
and departures picked at runtime (`settlements/voth/src/78c-life-ships.js`), so Godot cannot reproduce it from
the clock. The interiors walkers (`kits/interiors/API.md` §8) and the Ring Sea vessels (`rsWayPose`) are
already pure functions of t, and are the model.

- **[G data] Schedules as data:** `{route, period, phase, segments:[[dur, ease, from, to]...]}`, as for
  Homeworld's lifters and collector (`src/homeworld/fleet.js:135`: 14 s up, 6 s docked, 13 s down, offset per
  craft). Bake Voth's nav routes at build time, resolve slot conflicts offline, and drop the runtime
  avoidance and the random departures.
- **[G data] Formations:** offsets in the leader's tangent frame (`fleet.js:130`, Babylon 5's diamond). Use
  them for coast-guard escorts and strider convoys.
- **[G data] A queued harbour approach:** closing distance `9000(1-u)^1.6`, so ships slow as they arrive;
  lateral offsets merge into the lane, then a final alignment (`src/babylon5/station.js:624-700`).
- **[G data]** A closed-form launch from a rotating frame (Babylon 5), for habitats. Arrivals keyed to the
  schedule, spawning and despawning on it.
- **[G shader] Pose on the GPU:** once pose is a function of t, put phase and parameters in
  `INSTANCE_CUSTOM` and pose each instance in the vertex shader. No per-frame uploads, in three.js or Godot.
- **[G native]** Engine lights that stay a fixed size on screen: a MultiMesh of billboards with `fixed_size`.
- Avoid integrated pursuit (Homeworld's defenders) unless it is seeded and stepped at a fixed rate.

## Testing *(Menagerie)*

- **[G data]** Layout fingerprints compared with saved goldens, which can prove a refactor changed nothing in
  the world. Refuse an empty fingerprint. Taken over the export, the same fingerprint can check that the Godot
  import placed what three.js built.
- **[web]** Fail on WebGL and shader errors in the console.
- **[web]** Voth: set `_ready`, and replace the fixed sleeps with "N frames since ready".
- **[web]** `tools/test-all.py -j N`, running the `core/**/test-*.js` unit tests first; `build.py --check`
  for a stale `dist/`.
- **[web]** One shared `tools/harness.py` instead of 25 copies inside the `verify.py` files.
