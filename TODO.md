# Krator: to do

A working list. Items marked *(Menagerie)* come from reading the World Menagerie embedded at
`host/WorldMenagerie/` (paths below are under it). Its code is read for ideas only: anything taken is
rewritten as a Krator fragment, never imported from `host/` (`tools/check_insulation.py`).

**Godot tags.** The plan (`biomes/WORLD.md`) is that three.js generates and previews, and Godot runs the open
world. The port works when **what** a thing is (data) is kept apart from **how** three.js draws it
(`biomes/GODOT.md`, `core/atmos/GODOT.md`). Each item is tagged:

- **[G data]** engine-neutral: an algorithm or data that crosses over through the exporters as it is. This is
  the most valuable kind; do these as data first, drawing second.
- **[G shader]** a shader trick that rewrites directly into a `.gdshader` (often through the global shader
  parameters `core/atmos/GODOT.md` already defines).
- **[G native]** Godot has this built in. Worth doing in three.js only for the preview; don't port it.
- **[web]** browser or three.js only. No Godot value.

Prefer items that are straightforward to port. **Godot order:** (1) the carver's floor and blocker list,
which becomes collision shapes and the navigation mesh source; (2) the land-cover map, which becomes the
terrain splat texture and the placement input; (3) the minimap drawn from exported data.

**Counts:** about 15 [G data], 8 [G shader], 9 [G native] and 12 [web].

## Features

- **Minimap** *(Menagerie: `src/moria/walk.js:130-149`)* **[G data]**. A 2D canvas panel, drawn from data
  rather than from the rendered scene. A base layer is painted once into an offscreen canvas: every walkable
  floor, sorted by height so upper levels cover lower, coloured by level, with labels. Each update (at most
  4 Hz, only while the panel is open) copies the base layer and draws the viewer's dot and view wedge.
  Hovering names the floor under the pointer; clicking walks there.
  - For Krator: a shared `core/` fragment that paints from each build's `PLACED` list (footprint, rotation,
    tag) plus hill shading sampled from `terrainH()`, and water. Colour by tag, click to fly or walk.
    Start with Voth, whose `PLACED` list is already exposed (`settlements/voth/src/85-probe.js:73`).
  - Godot: the same records drawn in a `Control._draw()`, almost line for line. Better still, bake the base
    layer to a PNG at export time and ship it with the tile.
  - Optional: a one-time overhead orthographic bake to a texture as the background, for the painted look.
    Hide the sky, fog and inspector helpers during the bake.

## Underground and interiors *(Menagerie: Moria)*

- **[G data] The carver registers walkable floors and blockers as it builds** (`src/moria/carve.js`).
  `room()` and `passage()` write `{rect,y}` or `{a,b,w}` floors and `[x0,x1,z0,z1,y0,y1]` blocks as they
  build. The walker, the minimap and click-to-go all read that one list, so they can never disagree with the
  geometry. Krator's walk solids (girder `83-walk.js`) and its geometry are kept separately. In Godot the
  same list becomes collision shapes and a navigation mesh source; export it next to the geometry.
- **[G data] Walls are built split round their openings**, not cut afterwards: each wall is pieces left of,
  below, above and right of each opening (`carve.js:28-36`). No CSG is needed, and no hidden faces. The
  geometry exports as it is.
- **[G native] Draw underground only when you are under ground** (`src/moria/deep.js:15-24`). Everything built
  after a marker goes into one group. That group is drawn only when the camera is below the terrain or near
  a gate, and the terrain is hidden while you are under. It saved a laptop from crashing. Screamers' vaults
  and the dam tunnels could use this. Godot: occluders and visibility ranges do this, but the group toggle is
  one line if wanted.
- **[G data] Fade to dark underground, and carry a lantern** (`deep.js:26-41`): ease a 0-to-1 "under" value.
  Scale the sun, hemisphere and ambient down from the values the day/night code just set, close the fog in to
  black, and move a camera lantern that already exists at intensity 0. Lights are never added or removed,
  because that recompiles every material. Export the "under" volumes and the curve; Godot drives its
  Environment the same way.
- **[G native] Three moving lights for a whole city** (`src/moria/realm.js:31-44`). There are a few point
  lights, moved four times a second to the nearest of a list of light spots. Hundreds of lamp heads are one
  InstancedMesh of unlit material. Godot's Forward+ renderer handles many lights; the pool still matters on the
  Mobile and Compatibility renderers. Export the light spots either way.
- **[G shader] Shafts of daylight without lights** (`src/moria/halls.js:163-172`): an additive open cone from
  the window to the floor, an additive pool on the floor, and a bright sky card behind the opening.
- **[G shader] "See inside": the mountain as glass** (`deep.js:46`): terrain at opacity 0.18 with depth write
  off. Hidden features (the Endless Stair) are drawn only in that mode.
- **[G native] Polished stone underground uses Phong** (per pixel) so lantern light runs in the walls. Lambert
  is per vertex and loses a small light on big planes. Godot shading is always per pixel.
- **[G data] One switch for lit and dark states** (`src/moria/city.js:259-262`): a whole city changes from
  inhabited to ruined by swapping colours and emissive intensity, never geometry. This fits Krator's ruins and
  inhabited variants. Export both palettes.
- **[G data] The generator checks that every hall is covered by rock** (`tools/make-moria.py:20`). This could
  be an assert in `verify.py` for carved builds; run on the export, it guards the Godot side too.

## Fixes *(Menagerie runtime)*

- **[web]** Recover from a lost WebGL context: `preventDefault` on `webglcontextlost`, show a panel, restore.
  No Krator build does this (`src/core/shell.js:31-43`). One place for it is `gallery/krator-bar.js` `tune()`.
- **[web]** Isolate errors per subsystem in the frame loop. In Voth, `updateLife`, `skyAdvance` and the HUD
  sit outside the try (`settlements/voth/src/80-camera.js:303-319`), so one throw means it never draws again.
- **[web]** Input guards: clear held keys and pointers on blur and on hidden tabs; end a pointer when
  `buttons===0`; ignore keys while typing (`src/core/input.js`).
- **[web]** Leave a cut plane installed and park it at `constant=1e7`, instead of swapping `clippingPlanes`
  and recompiling (`settlements/yuni/src/76-doors.js:259`, `kits/interiors/src-walk/70-walk.js:213`).
- **[web]** Call `renderer.compile(scene,camera)` before hiding the loader.
- **[web]** Redraw the shadow map only when the target moves or the sun turns.
- **[G native]** Adaptive resolution (detail before pixels, remember a ratio that failed, hysteresis). Godot
  has resolution scaling built in; the controller logic would carry over if it is ever needed there.

## Rendering ideas *(Menagerie)*

- **[G shader]** Cloud shadows and rain darkening through one shared shader chunk (`src/core/env.js:102-118`).
  Godot: a shared `.gdshaderinc` over the `atm_*` globals; apply the cloud shade in `light()`.
- **[G shader]** Lit windows as an emissive texture for massed and distant facades
  (`src/engine/stages/03-blocks.js`).
- **[G shader]** Lamp schedules computed per instance on the GPU (`env.js:82,192-197`). This matches
  `core/atmos/GODOT.md`, which already puts hours in `INSTANCE_CUSTOM`.
- **[G native]** A dithered fade before LOD drops an object (`env.js:170-181`). Godot's visibility range has a
  dithered fade mode.
- **[G shader]** Fill a cut solid by drawing its back faces as flat hatching (`src/blame/mats.js:166-176`).
  Godot: `FRONT_FACING` in a `.gdshader`.
- **[G native]** A per-frame bounding sphere for movers, so off-screen herds and boats are culled. Godot: a
  MultiMesh `custom_aabb`.
- **[web]** One shared polygon-offset ladder. **[G data]** A shared mitred ribbon helper for roads, rivers and
  walls, whose output is plain geometry.

## Worlds *(Menagerie)*

These are the best Godot candidates: generators whose output is data.

- **[G data]** One land-cover map per world, read by both the ground shader and plant placement
  (`tools/make-yellowstone.py:457-575`, `src/yellowstone/nature.js`). In Godot it is a splat texture for the
  terrain shader and the input to placement.
- **[G data]** A warped-lattice field and hedgerow generator for the highlands and lowlands
  (`tools/make-shire.py:152-178`).
- **[G data]** Mountain height functions: range walls, junctions that don't double up, volcano cones
  (`tools/make-mordor.py:84-181`).
- **[G shader]** Distant mountain ranges drawn at their true angular size as a backdrop
  (`src/minastirith/shadow.js`). A seamless open world may not want it, except for ranges beyond the map.
- **[G data] + [G shader]** River foam driven by slope (stored per vertex), and a water surface that never
  climbs downstream (`src/rivendell/water.js`, `src/isengard/isen.js`).
- **[G native]** Pull a buried camera back along its line of sight (`src/blame/main.js:115-142`): Godot has
  SpringArm3D. A circle walker with corner push-out (`src/backrooms/level.js:395-419`), and a lift you can
  ride: CharacterBody3D does both, platform motion included.
- **[G data]** Chunks generated from the seed alone, with doors forced at chunk edges
  (`src/backrooms/level.js`). This is the same tile-by-tile loading `biomes/WORLD.md` plans.
- **[G data]** Timed set pieces as pure functions of t, publishing signals on a bus (`src/fleshpit/incident.js`).

## Testing *(Menagerie)*

- **[G data]** Layout fingerprints compared with saved goldens, which can prove a refactor changed nothing in
  the world. Refuse an empty fingerprint. Taken over the export, the same fingerprint can check that the Godot
  import placed what three.js built.
- **[web]** Fail on WebGL and shader errors in the console.
- **[web]** Voth: set `_ready`, and replace the fixed sleeps with "N frames since ready".
- **[web]** `tools/test-all.py -j N`, running the `core/**/test-*.js` unit tests first; `build.py --check`
  for a stale `dist/`.
- **[web]** One shared `tools/harness.py` instead of 25 copies inside the `verify.py` files.
