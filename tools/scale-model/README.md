# Scale model tools

Scripts that edit the **Krator Scale Model** artifact
(https://claude.ai/artifact/N76KxfMXL5C7hfRGHKJK5q), now version 4.19. The artifact's rasters live inside the page
(a `DATA` object on one long line); the generator that made them is not in this repo, so these
scripts edit the decoded rasters directly and write a new page.

Working folder: decode every base64 raster from the 4.9 page (`orig.html`) into `<key>.png/.jpg`,
export the regions collection from the artifact's database as JSON, then:

1. `inner_wall_smooth.py 50 6`: soften the Inner Wall's outer flank, about 50 km either side of
   the 'Inner Crater' outline (writes `old_e.npy`, `new_e.npy`). Save `new_e.npy` as `e411.npy`.
2. `features.py <regions> <mesa ids>... --bay <id> --isles <id> 0.2`: weather the mesas in the
   given regions, carve the Bay of Voth off the Ring Sea, and raise geyser islands over 20% of the
   West Ring isles' water (heights, water, levels, geysers, masks).
   For 4.13, save that pass's outputs as `e412.npy`, `water412.npy`, `whas412.npy`, `wlev412.npy`,
   `feat412.npz`, then `features2.py <regions> --water <id> --flatten <id> --border <id> 80
   --join <id>`: region 42 to shallow sea, region 41's plateaus lowered, the cliff on Crag Men's
   northern border eased (80 km either side), Spice isle joined into one landmass.
   For 4.14, save 4.13's outputs as `e413.npy`, `water413.npy`, `whas413.npy`, `wlev413.npy`,
   `feat413.npz` (and its island geysers as `geysers413.json`, copied back to `geysers_new.json`),
   then `features3.py <regions> <4.13 page> --bridge <id> 485,520 575,504 --geysers <id> 5`: the
   land bridge from Spice isle to the volcano (checked connected), and geysers on land placed far
   from every vent and well inside the region (`geysers_land.json`).
3. `assemble.py 4.14 out.html`: write the heights and water, re-shade the textures to the new
   relief, paint the islands from East Ring Isles donors and the bay from the sea, update zones,
   climate class and temperatures, add the geysers to `vents`.
4. `patch_ui.py out.html final.html`: political / geographic / biome region layers, the tabbed
   list, the layer switch on each region, and labels along long, thin regions.

Everything is deterministic (fixed seeds).

## 4.15 to 4.19: `edit_heights.py` (Oct 2026)

`edit_heights.py <4.14 page> <regions.json> <settlements.json> <out page>` edits the 4.14 page in one pass and writes
`<out>.report.json` beside it:

1. **The lakes.** A water body standing more than 600 m over the lower quartile of its shore is lowered to it, unless
   the model records its outlet (`DATA.outlets`, a lake over falls). 4.14 held five such pools in and north of the
   eastern abyss (levels 0, -50 and -900 m over a floor near -2,300 m); 366 cells.
2. **The eastern abyss as an escarpment** (the owner: like the Inner Wall's inner rim). Round the abyss's floor, each
   rim cell is placed between the floor's and the plateau's level there and its share of the rise sharpened: the
   plateau runs level to the edge and drops within about one cell. Steepest step 1,192 -> ~2,400 m per 4 km cell.
3. **The valley of Yuni**: ranges of ridged noise flank an axis from Yuni to the north-west (peaks to ~4.5 km), closed
   by a head ridge south-east of the city; the valley floor stays near 650 m and opens north-west toward the abyss.
4. **Mountains in marked regions** (4.16): every region named in `MOUNTAINS` is filled with ridged peaks that rise from
   its edge to its middle and join the land by the higher of the two. 'Region 61' (the owner's, the valley of Yuni's
   south-eastern head): peaks to ~4.7 km.
5. **4.17, from the owner's marked regions:** `GENTLE` ('east rim', 'Region 64') keep the gentle drop they had in 4.14
   (no escarpment there); the valley of Yuni's mouth runs down its axis to the abyss's floor in one long ramp;
   `HUMPS` ('Region 62') raises the abyss's floor ~750 m into a saddle between the basins north and south of it;
   `CUTS` ('Region 63') cuts the region to the floor (-2,330 m) with a salt lake (-2,305 m) at its middle, a gentle rim
   round it, and its climate class and zone set to abyssal desert and salt basin (the lake: abyssal salt lake).
6. **4.18:** `LEVELS` ('passage') brings a region to an average height (+200 m) with its relief softened and its edge
   blended on every side; then **rain, climate class and zone are recomputed** wherever the heights changed (`reclimate`).
   The generator that made them is not in the repo, so a changed cell takes them from the unchanged land cells most
   like it nearby (place, height, windward slope under the north-west wind, mean temperature: 12 nearest, weighted),
   the rain smoothed and the classes majority-filtered so new ridges are not banded; the rain and climate maps (`rt`,
   `ct`) are repainted where they changed (each pixel scaled by its new colour over its old, keeping the shading).
   4.18 recomputed 18,362 cells; 7,945 changed class.
7. **4.19:**
   - **The class follows the cell's own climate.** 4.18 voted the class apart from the rain, so 885 cells took a humid
     rain (over 1,000 mm) under the abyssal desert class: half inside Region 63, whose cut forced the class but kept the
     rain the land had before. Now a cut's rain is the dry abyss floor's (the median of XW within 40 px, ~220 mm, eased
     4 px into its edge), and each recomputed cell takes its class from its nearest twins in climate (rain, the mean,
     warmest and coldest temperatures, air pressure), only among classes whose 2nd to 98th percentile of rain it falls in.
     A cut's forced cells are no twins. No majority filter on the class (the climate decides it). XW over 1,000 mm: 0.
   - **No edit raises an existing lake's bed:** uplift is taken off the lakes and eased back over 2 cells (the valley's
     north-east range had run its toe into the lake at Locus, lifting 16 cells to +300 m under water at -2,400 m).
   - **Rivers (`RIVERS`):** routed by least cost over the edited heights (climbing dear, low ground cheap) from a source
     to the water cells of a lake (`to`: a region's lake, or `('near', <settlement>)` the lake nearest it), the bed carved
     40 m deep and falling all the way, the banks eased; drawn on the satellite and relief maps along a smoothed,
     gently meandering course; written into `DATA.rivers` (`name`, `px` the course in map px, `to`). The Yuni river:
     from the valley's head (730 m) past Yuni, down the mouth's ramp and into the lake at Locus (-2,400 m).
   - **The region tool (`UI_FIXES`):** `importCityRegions` never closed, so the settlements' hover sat inside it and
     every pointer move threw once it had run; and region handles were picked by ray against spheres a few pixels
     across. Now the function closes, handles are picked in screen space (the nearest within 16 px, the camera's
     matrices refreshed first) and drawn twice the size. Tested in a browser: a drag started 9 px off a corner moves it
     and saves.
   - Heights are clamped to the format's range when written (a carve below -2,600 m wrapped to +17 km).
8. The painted images are re-lit where the heights changed and the temperatures lapse-corrected. The climate class and
   zone rasters are recomputed since 4.18 (step 6).

Publish the result to the artifact's URL (strip the document skeleton the read returns: everything before `<title>`
and the closing `</body></html>`).

## Cutting a region out for the open world

`extract_region.py <page.html> <regions> <settlements> "<region name>" <out dir>` reads the same page (no edit) and
writes what an open-world build reads: the heights and water on their own grid, the climate class, rain, temperature,
the biome overlays (smaller wins an overlap; uncovered pixels take the nearest overlay), the region's mask, the
drainage network, the named rivers (`DATA.rivers`: the course every 4th point with the carved height under it, a
width and a water depth), the settlements inside the polygon and the canyon candidates for each ruin. The escarpment's
sharpening is kept off a named river's corridor (off within 3 cells, back by 6): the river's descent is the owner's. `openworld/little-demo/`
is the first user (its README.md says how to refresh it).
