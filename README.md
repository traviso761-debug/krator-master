# City of Iziz

Procedural city models served to the local network by a small Python server. Two cities so far:
**Iziz**, a science-fantasy city with its own language, and **Chicago**. Both run on the same core
modules and the same page shell; each city is a data file plus a set of build stages.

**Site:** http://192.168.124.227:8000/

## Site map

| URL | Also at | File | Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | `/index.html`, `/iziz`, `/iziz.html` | `iziz.html` | Iziz: massing model |
| `/?city=iziz-b` | | `data/cities/iziz-b.json` | A variant Iziz (rounder wall, another seed, more prints) |
| `/chicago` | `/chicago.html` | `chicago.html` | Chicago: massing model |
| `/tongue` | `/izani-tongue` | `The-Izani-Tongue_2.html` | The Izani Tongue |
| `/painting.jpg` | | `painting.jpg` | The Iziz painting; `image.png` is the master copy |
| `/css/*`, `/src/*`, `/data/*`, `/vendor/*` | | those folders | stylesheets, modules, content, three.js |
| `/healthz` | | (built in) | Returns `ok` |

Any other URL returns 404. A trailing slash is ignored.

### `/`: Iziz

A 3D city built with three.js (served locally from `vendor/`, so the LAN works without internet).
Its state lives in the URL:

**Query parameters** (`/?seed=42&city=iziz-b`)

| Parameter | Effect |
|---|---|
| `seed=N` | Builds a different city (1 to 2147483646). Each city file sets its default (Iziz: 1337). |
| `city=name` | Loads `data/cities/name.json` (default `iziz`). |
| `debug` | Prints the build timing table to the console and exposes the lot list. |

**Hash parameters** (`/#v=...&t=...`): the page keeps these current as you move; **Copy link** in the
Views panel copies them. `v` = camera position and target (6 numbers), `t` = hour, `paused`,
`wire` (`off`/`edges`/`triangles`), `under` (`solid`/`hidden`/`xray`), `colour`
(`textured`/`clay`/`districts`), `life=0`, `weather` (`auto`/`clear`/`rain`/`fog`/`dust`/`windy`),
`day` (`120`/`360`/`720`/`1440`). Example: `/#v=0,720,620,0,20,0&t=18&weather=fog`.

Built-in views: Painting view, Overview, Palace, Temple plaza, Street level, Bridge, Spaceport, Arena,
Arena floor, Temple top, Temple hall, and depending on the city: Sewer outfall, River falls, Rope
bridge, The lake, The docks, Dock road, Painting print. Saved views and display settings live in the
viewer's browser (`localStorage`), not on the server.

**The painting in the city.** Six wall posters in the inner city are framed prints of `painting.jpg`
(count and frame in `data/cities/iziz.json` under `art`). If the image can't load, they stay posters.

### `/chicago`: Chicago

The same shell and controls, a different generator: a metre-scale street grid centred on State &
Madison, Lake Michigan east of x = 900, the river's main stem and both branches with a bridge at
every street, Grant and Millennium Parks, Navy Pier and its wheel, a skyline field by district,
twenty-one parametric landmarks (click one for its card), the elevated Loop with running trains,
traffic, tour boats and sailboats, a sun that rises over the lake and windows that light at dusk.
Hash: `#v=...&t=hour[&paused]`. Views: Skyline from the lake, The Loop, Riverwalk, Millennium Park,
Navy Pier, Willis Tower, Michigan Avenue, Overview. Positions are approximate: it is a massing model.

### `/tongue`: The Izani Tongue

A self-contained reference page (no scripts). Its **City lexicon** tables are generated from
`data/lexicon.json` by `tools/build-tongue.py`; the rest is hand-written. The 84 glyphs baked into it
are reproduced exactly by `src/izani/glyphs.js`, which the test suite checks.

### Not served

`image.png` (master painting), `The-Izani-Tongue_2.pdf`, everything under `tools/`, `tests/`,
`server.py`, `site.toml`, `sitectl`, the docs.

## Layout

```
iziz.html, chicago.html      page shells: containers + <script type="module" src="src/<city>/main.js">
css/                          iziz.css (shared shell), chicago.css (colours)
data/
  cities/<name>.json          a city's parameters (expressions allowed, see the file's note)
  lexicon.json                Izani words, inscriptions, place names, lore, canon
src/
  core/   diag.js rng.js env.js data.js      error reporting + staged loading, randomness/noise, shader environment, data expressions
  izani/  glyphs.js draw.js atlas.js          the script: strokes/layout/SVG (pure), canvas drawing, the texture atlas
  iziz/   main.js imports.js stages/*.js build.js   the Iziz build: 56 stage files, assembled into build.js
  chicago/ main.js imports.js stages/*.js build.js  the Chicago build: 8 stage files

tools/  build-page.py build-tongue.py probe.py
tests/  run.js *.test.js golden/ fixtures/
server.py  site.toml  sitectl
```

### Stages and `build.js`

A city's code is a set of numbered files in `src/<city>/stages/`. They are fragments of one function
body: `tools/build-page.py` concatenates them in order into `src/<city>/build.js` as
`export async function build(ctx){ … }`, so every stage sees what earlier stages defined, and
`section('name', () => {…})` isolates a stage's failure while `await stage('name')` yields to the
loading text. Things one stage hands to a later one, or to the console, go on `ctx` (`window._iz`).
**Edit the stages, never `build.js`**; `./sitectl build` regenerates it (and `check`, `reload`,
`restart`, `test` and the probe do so automatically).

### Content files

Numbers are numbers; a string is an expression over the values defined above it, `Math` and
`rad(degrees)`, evaluated by `src/core/data.js`. `_` keys are comments. `data/cities/iziz.json` holds
the landmark positions, wall shape, gates, districts, statues, views, constellations and print
settings; `data/lexicon.json` holds every Izani word (`words`, grouped), the carved and painted
inscriptions (`inscriptions`), the landmark → inscription map (`placeNames`), `lore` and `canon`.
After editing the lexicon run `python3 tools/build-tongue.py` to refresh the Tongue page's tables.

### Adding a city

1. `data/cities/<name>.json` for an Iziz-engine variant, opened with `/?city=<name>`; or
2. a new page: `<name>.html` (copy `chicago.html`), `src/<name>/{main.js,imports.js,stages/}`, a
   route in `site.toml`, and `python3 tools/probe.py --page <name>.html --save-golden tests/golden/<name>-<seed>.json`.

### Seeds

The building layout comes from one seeded stream consumed in stage order. Adding a random draw in an
early stage changes every later one, for every seed. `tests/golden/*.json` records the layout of each
page at known seeds; `./sitectl test` fails if it moves. Decoration that should not disturb the layout
uses `hash3(x, z, k)` or its own `mkRng(seed)` stream.

## Managing the server

Use `./sitectl` from this folder. Never run it with `sudo`; it refuses.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `./sitectl status` | Service state and the site URLs |
| `./sitectl reload` | Build, check `site.toml`, then apply it with no downtime (alias `apply`) |
| `./sitectl restart` | Build, check, restart. Use after editing `server.py`, host or port. |
| `./sitectl start` / `stop` | Start or stop the server |
| `./sitectl enable` / `disable` | Start now and at every login / stop and don't start at login |
| `./sitectl build` | Assemble `src/<city>/build.js` from the stage files |
| `./sitectl check` | Build, validate `site.toml`, list every URL. Nothing else changes. |
| `./sitectl test [seconds]` | Module tests under gjs, then a headless build of every golden page/seed |
| `./sitectl probe …` | `tools/probe.py` with your arguments (metrics, fingerprints, screenshots) |
| `./sitectl logs [N]` / `follow` | Last N log lines / live log |
| `./sitectl url` / `health` | Print the URLs / ask the running server if it's up |
| `./sitectl install` | Rewrite the systemd unit for this folder (after moving the project) |
| `./sitectl boot` | How to start the site at boot without a login |

Editing HTML, CSS, data files or images needs no command: files are read on every request and the
server sends `304 Not Modified` when the browser's copy is current. Editing a stage file needs
`./sitectl build` (or any command that runs it). Editing `server.py` needs `restart`.

### Testing

```
./sitectl test          # everything
gjs -m tests/run.js     # only the module tests (rng, noise, data expressions, Izani glyphs)
python3 tools/probe.py --page chicago.html --wait 20                          # metrics for one load
python3 tools/probe.py --seed 42 --expect tests/golden/iziz-42.json           # did the layout move?
python3 tools/probe.py --page chicago.html --hash 'v=-100,12,-620,-600,30,-690&t=21' --shot night.jpg
```

The probe runs the page in headless Firefox against a copy of the site config and reports errors,
build timings, draw calls, triangles, programs, frame times, the adaptive resolution and a SHA-256
fingerprint of the building layout. `--shot` saves the rendered canvas as a JPEG.

## Configuration (`site.toml`)

Workflow: edit, `./sitectl check`, `./sitectl reload`. If the new config is invalid the server keeps
the old one and logs `reload failed`. Changing `host` or `port` needs `restart`.

`[server]`: `host` (`0.0.0.0` = whole network, `127.0.0.1` = this machine), `port`, `log_requests`,
`health` (URL that answers `ok`), `[server.headers]` sent with every response.

```toml
[[route]]                      # one file at one or more URLs
path = "/lexicon"
aliases = ["/words"]
file = "lexicon.html"
title = "Izani lexicon"        # shown by --check
enabled = true
[route.headers]
"Cache-Control" = "max-age=600"

[[mount]]                      # a whole folder under a prefix; no listings, no escaping the folder
prefix = "/assets"
dir = "assets"
```

Exact routes win over mounts; the longest mount prefix wins. Root-relative links (`/tongue`) keep
working if the address or port changes.

## The server

`server.py` (stdlib only, Python 3.11+): allowlisted routes and mounts, HTTP/1.1 keep-alive, gzip
for text when the client accepts it, `ETag`/`Last-Modified` with `304`, `HEAD`, a health URL, SIGHUP
reload, one log line per request in the journal. No `Range` support, no TLS, no authentication:
fine on the LAN, never port-forward it to the internet.

The systemd **user** service `iziz` (`~/.config/systemd/user/iziz.service`) runs it; the unit runs
`server.py --check` before starting, so a missing page file stops start-up. Raw commands, without
`sudo`: `systemctl --user status|start|stop|restart|reload iziz`, `journalctl --user -fu iziz`. With
`sudo` they fail with `Failed to connect to user scope bus`. The service starts at login; for boot
without a login run `sudo loginctl enable-linger snapwerks` once.

## Network notes

- The router assigns `192.168.124.227` and may change it (`hostname -I`; reserve it in the router).
- The firewall is off. If you enable one: `sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp`.
- Everything is served locally; no page needs the internet.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---|---|
| Page doesn't load | `./sitectl status`, `./sitectl health` |
| Service won't start | `./sitectl logs 20`: a `problem:` line names the missing file |
| A stage edit has no effect | `./sitectl build` (the served file is `build.js`) |
| Red box on the page | that stage failed; the rest still builds. `./sitectl probe --page …` shows the same text |
| `LAYOUT CHANGED` from `test` | a random draw moved: see Seeds above; if intended, re-save the golden with `--save-golden` |
| New route is 404 | `./sitectl check` shows the route table; then `reload` |
| Works locally, not from other devices | IP changed, other network, or a firewall |
| `Failed to connect to user scope bus` | you used `sudo`. Drop it. |

See `AUDIT.md` for the architecture audit this layout came from and what is still open.
