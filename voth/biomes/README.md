# Biomes

The home tree of every Krator biome kit. Each kit is one self-contained flora (and fauna)
system on the shared biome core (`BIOME-API.md` inside each kit): `src/` fragments,
`build.py` (concatenates them into `dist/<name>.html` and syntax-checks), `verify.py`
(headless Chromium: error panel, probe invariants, screenshots), `NOTES.md` and
`KNOWN_ISSUES.md`. `krator-biome-<name>.zip` is the same kit, packed.

| kit | what |
|-----|------|
| `hyperjungle/` | the central hyperjungle, the core's origin: six hypertree species, understorey, epiphyte gardens, fauna |
| `eastabyss/` | the eastern abyss: salt lake, flats and marsh, coal-swamp abyssal jungle, the shelf, mat reed beds |
| `sedesert/` | the eastern high desert: red desert with Socotran flora, mesas, hoodoos, a river canyon ending in a cataract over the Abyss, fauna |
| `rift/` | the Rift: an algal salt lake, abyssal jungle, a benched ridge of mesas (cloud forest, Mediterranean crest), abyssal savannah |
| `swbay/` | the southwest bay: bay hyperjungle, rainforest, parasol savannah, the volcano, stepped cataracts, a ruined jetty, fauna |
| `swlowlands/` | the southwestern lowlands: sprawl oaks, an oak avenue, cork grove, crown-flowering trees, understorey |
| `xanadu/` | the East Rift Highlands: the Vale of Xanadu, an enclosed mountain lake and the sacred river from its chasm; ornamental wildwood (bonsai and topiary habits, agate wood, fairy rings, hornbeam arches, lotus trumpets), Hyrcanian flanks, Mediterranean uplands; the core's runtime LOD |
| `nwlowlands/` | the northwestern lowlands: lake shore, humid-subtropical tract, Mediterranean foothills, vertical Asian/Australian trees, bamboo groves, glow-willows |

Build: `cd <kit> && python3 build.py`. Verify: `python3 verify.py dist/<kit>.html --assert --views "..."`.

Worlds that use a biome (`iziz/`, `screamers/`, `ancients/`) carry their own vendored copies
of its fragments. Edit the kit here, then copy across; `iziz/build.py --vendor-check` reports drift.
