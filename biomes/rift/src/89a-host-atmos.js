// 2026-10-20, phase 0 of the water migration: core/atmos's one-time init on this page's frame ticks, ground and camera, so core/water
// (WATER.draw, drawStill: they need ATMOS.init, and for the sky in the water the skylight) and the open world's one clock can take
// this biome. The binding alone draws nothing (ATMOS.root is an empty group) and changes no page value: the dome, fog, sun and the
// page's own water stay as they were. The hour is the page's sun, fixed (13); the module's clock is the host's dt.
